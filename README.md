# Sales-Data-Insights-With-Power-BI

Using the Adventure Works dataset provided by Microsoft, sales data was imported, transformed, and cleaned in Power Query as part of the ETL process to ensure data accuracy. A comprehensive data model was created in Power BI, where DAX measures and time intelligence functions were applied to generate insights and support advanced sales analysis. Additionally, an interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize key performance metrics and trends, facilitating data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.
